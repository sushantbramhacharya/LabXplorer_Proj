   - **Key Concepts**: Acid-base reaction, gas production, chemical change.

2. **Density Column**
   - **Description**: Create a colorful density column using liquids of different densities, such as honey, water, and oil.
   - **Key Concepts**: Density, immiscibility, layering.

3. **Magic Milk**
   - **Description**: Add food coloring to milk and then touch the surface with a cotton swab dipped in dish soap, causing the colors to swirl.
   - **Key Concepts**: Surface tension, emulsification, chemical reactions.

4. **Salt Crystals**
   - **Description**: Dissolve salt in hot water and let it evaporate over a few days to form salt crystals.
   - **Key Concepts**: Solubility, evaporation, crystallization.

5. **Elephant Toothpaste**
   - **Description**: Mix hydrogen peroxide, dish soap, and yeast to create a rapid foaming reaction that looks like toothpaste for an elephant.
   - **Key Concepts**: Catalysis, exothermic reaction, decomposition.

### Physics Experiments

1. **Balloon Rocket**
   - **Description**: Inflate a balloon and release it along a string to demonstrate Newtonâ€™s Third Law of Motion.
   - **Key Concepts**: Action and reaction, forces, motion.

2. **Simple Pendulum**
   - **Description**: Create a simple pendulum with a string and a weight to explore the effects of length and weight on the pendulum's period.
   - **Key Concepts**: Periodic motion, gravity, oscillation.

3. **Paper Airplane Flight**
   - **Description**: Design and fly paper airplanes to study how different designs affect flight distance and stability.
   - **Key Concepts**: Aerodynamics, lift, drag.

4. **Magnetic Attraction**
   - **Description**: Use different magnets and objects to explore magnetic attraction and repulsion.
   - **Key Concepts**: Magnetism, poles, force fields.

5. **Shadow Play**
   - **Description**: Use a flashlight and various objects to create and study shadows of different shapes and sizes.
   - **Key Concepts**: Light, shadows, opacity.

### Electronics Experiments

1. **Simple Circuit**
   - **Description**: Build a basic circuit using a battery, a light bulb, and connecting wires to understand how electricity flows.
   - **Key Concepts**: Circuit, conductivity, current.

2. **Paper Circuit**
   - **Description**: Create a simple circuit on a piece of paper using conductive tape, an LED, and a coin cell battery.

### Basic Computer Science Experiments for Kids

1. **Scratch Programming Basics**
   - **Description**: Introduce kids to programming by creating simple animations or games using Scratch. Students can drag and drop code blocks to make a character move, speak, or interact with objects.
   - **Key Concepts**: Programming logic, sequences, events.

2. **Unplugged Activity: Sorting Network**
   - **Description**: Create a physical sorting network using ropes and labels. Kids can act as data elements and follow paths to sort themselves according to the instructions. This helps them understand how sorting algorithms work without using a computer.
   - **Key Concepts**: Sorting algorithms, algorithmic thinking, teamwork. 

These activities are designed to be simple, interactive, and educational, making it easy for kids to grasp basic computer science concepts.
